  "imageDescription": "The image shows an interior wall with a modern design. The wall appears to be split into different sections with distinct colors and patterns. On the left side, there is a gradient color transition from a mustard yellow to light yellow, accompanied by a dot pattern that seems to get sparser towards the bottom. The middle section displays a more solid color, possibly two shades of brown or taupe, also with a very subtle dot pattern creating a gradient effect. On the right, there's a section of wall painted in a light teal blue color. In the lower right corner, there's a red fire exit sign mounted on the wall, indicating an emergency exit. The ceiling or upper part of the image features an overhanging structure that adds to the contemporary aesthetic of the space.",
